## Goals
The primary goals for this project moving forward are to answer the following questions: 
 <br><br>
	1.) **Do branch length summary statistics differ across protein models?**
	 <br><br>
	   -Will include one lm model per summary statistic as `statistic ~ protein_model+ASRV`
	   <br><br>
	2.) **Does literal branch lengths differ?**
	   One lm per pair of protein models, per dataset, as `protein_model_bl ~ protein_model_bl`
