+ Is there a difference in evolutionary properties (entropy or dnds) between sites without much and with a lot of bias?
+ How does the bias relate to model preference? Are the bias rankings consistent with model rankings?
+ Make linear models of specific branch lengths. I guess this is a lot of one-sample t-tests, one t-test for each branch length and then divide all p-values by the number of branch lengths in the sims (something like 30?
+ Can we figure out at which branch lengths the relationship starts to get borked? Can do like a systematic exclusion of higher bl to find when the bias is p>0.05?
